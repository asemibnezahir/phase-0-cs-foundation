1. We need long long int data type when our input variable is more than 10 to the power 9 which can't be stored in 4byte space.
2.Rules of Naming a Variable:
  a) only can be started with letter or underscore.
  b) letter, underscore & numbers only can be used.
  c) C programming keywords can not be used.
3. Code is Written bellow:

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a,b;
    scanf("%d %d",&a,&b);
    printf("%d %d",b,a);
    return 0;
}
