1.Code is Written bellow:

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int number;
    scanf("%d",&number);
    if(number%2==0){
        printf("The Number is Even.\n");
    }
    else{
        printf("The Number is Odd.\n");
    }
    return 0;
}




2.Code is Written bellow:

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int number;
    scanf("%d",&number);
    if(number<0)
    {
        printf("This Number is Negative");
    }
    else if(number>0)
    {
        printf("This Number is Positive");
    }
    else

3. If else ladder is chain of logic in c programming which starts with 
"if" and ends with "else" and we can add "else if" if we want to add more 
logic in a ladder.
